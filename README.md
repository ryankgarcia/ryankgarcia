# Hi there, I'm Ryan üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

I‚Äôm a graduate of the LearningFuze Web Development Program, where I learned how to build user-friendly full stack applications. Before transitioning into tech, I studied Business Administration and spent a few years in different business roles which have all added to my diverse understanding of business management and operations. 

Over the years, I realized that technology has always been my strong suit and I wanted to pursue a career where I could grow and contribute at a high level. Throughout my life I had always been drawn to tech and knew I was going to end up taking this path as I enjoy solving problems and learning new things each day.
